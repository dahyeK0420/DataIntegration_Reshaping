This program aims to collect data regarding features of properties in a dataset. The features include the suburb the property is located at, shortest distance to areas such as supermarket, train stations, shopping centres, and hospitals. It also includes the travel distance to the CBD Melbourne via the nearest station retrieved from given dataset. After completing the data set on the property, the program builds a model to predict the property price basd on its linear relationship with continuous variables in the dataset. The model aims to evaluate whether the property is overpriced in respect to its surrounding environments and features.
